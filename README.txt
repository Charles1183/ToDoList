ToDoList Android Application:
This app was a design to allow the users to create a list of students using the build SQLite database.
I created this to learn how to use the SQLite database to store user created data.
When using the app inorder to see any changes done to the list you must click the "List All"
button in the main screen.
You can also click on the student names in the list to view their details.
Use Android Studio to run the app on either an emulator in device.
Works on APK 14:Android 4.00 or later.
